    <h3>Comparing Energy Efficiency Strategies: Lessons from Sweden for Nigeria</h3>

    <p>
      Sweden shows a very compelling case of how high energy consumption does not have to translate into high emissions.
      Sweden consumes large amounts of energy per capita; however, it maintains low carbon emissions through deliberate
      energy choices rooted in renewables and nuclear power.
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, Nigeria’s energy system is limited by inefficiencies, reliance on fossil fuel, and underutilization
      of available renewable resources, despite vast natural potential in the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of Sweden’s strongest advantages is its diversified renewable mix: hydropower, bioenergy, wind, and nuclear
      energy which collectively account for nearly all electricity generation. In 2023,
      <em>“98.5 per cent of Sweden’s electricity came from renewable sources or nuclear power”</em>
      (Swedish Institute, 2024).
    </p>

    <p>
      This contrasts sharply with Nigeria’s reality, where electricity generation relies heavily on gas-fired turbines
      and coal plants. Frequent grid failures force households and businesses to depend on private generators;
      an outcome that is costly, inefficient, and polluting. Nigeria’s energy choices therefore increase emissions
      while also delivering unreliable supply.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, another area where Sweden excels is policy design. The Electricity Certificate System obliges
      retailers to purchase green electricity, while producers are incentivized to generate renewable power.
      Nigeria lacks this type of coherent market-based framework; although renewable energy policies exist,
      enforcement is weak and investment security remains low. Solar and wind projects are often small-scale
      and fragmented (IEA, 2023).
    </p>

    <p>
      To advise Nigeria’s government from an efficiency standpoint, three priorities stand out:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Scale decentralized renewables, particularly solar mini-grids for rural and peri-urban communities.</li>
      <li>Introduce policy incentives similar to Sweden’s certification system.</li>
      <li>Invest in energy efficiency technologies such as heat pumps and combined heat-and-power systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In conclusion, Nigeria’s challenge is not resource scarcity – it is governance and execution.
      As Sweden demonstrates, strategic planning, long-term policy consistency, and investment in renewables
      can deliver reliable energy with low emissions.
